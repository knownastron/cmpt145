# CMPT 145: Linear ADTs
# Defines the Stack ADT
#
# A stack (also called a pushdown or LIFO stack) is a compound data structure
# in which the data values are ordered according to the LIFO
# (last-in first-out) protocol.
#
# Implementation:
# This implementation uses Python lists directly.  Essentially,
# it adapts the list and imposes the stack protocol upon it.
# Here, stack grows from 0, and push/pop happen at the "end" of the list
